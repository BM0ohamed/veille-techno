"Introducing ConTextual: How well can your Multimodal model jointly reason over text and image in text-rich scenes?",""," The ability to reason about the interactions between the interactions of text and visual context in images can power many real-world applications, such as AI assistants, or tools to assist the visually impaired. We hope that this benchmark will help in developing nuanced vision-language alignment techniques."
"StarCoder2 and The Stack v2",""," StarCod2-15B model is trained on over 4 trillion tokens and 600+ programming languages from The Stack v2. The Stack is the largest open code dataset suitable for pretraining. BigCode is releasing StarCoder2, the next generation of transparently trained open code LLMs."
"AI Watermarking 101: Tools and Techniques",""," We present some of the tools available on the Hugging Face Hub for adding/detecting watermarks. In this blog post, we will describe how to carry out watermarking of AI-powered content. We present the tools to use in-depth watermarks on the site."
"Fine-Tuning Gemma Models in Hugging Face",""," Gemma, the open weights language model from Google Deepmind, is now available to the open-source community. In this post, we will review how you can use the model to improve your performance. The model is based on the model of the language used by Google's algorithm."
"Welcome Gemma - Googleâ€™s new open LLM",""," Gemma is a family of 4 open-source models that Google has released. The models come in two sizes: 2B and 7B, each with instruction-tuned versions. All the variants can be run on consumer hardware and have a context length of 8K tokens."
"NPHardEval Leaderboard: Unveiling the Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models through Complexity Classes and Dynamic Updates",""," Researchers from University of Michigan and Rutgers University introduce NPHardEval, a benchmark for Large Language Models. NPHardsEval uses 900 algorithmic questions spanning the NP-Hard complexity class and lower. NphardEVal is designed to test the strength of the language."
