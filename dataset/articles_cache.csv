"AI Watermarking 101: Tools and Techniques"|"Published February 26, 2024"|" There are two methods for watermarking AI-generated content: the first occurs during content creation and the second is implemented after the content is produced. Some tools that imperceptibly alter images include Glaze and Photoguard. Other tools include Nightshade and Fawkes."|"https://huggingface.co/blog/watermarking"
"Fine-Tuning Gemma Models in Hugging Face"|"Published February 23, 2024"|" Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT) for Gemma models is a popular technique to accomplish this at low cost. The PEFT library provides an easy abstraction that allows users to select the model layers. This can greatly accelerate the fine-tuning speed."|"https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma-peft"
"Welcome Gemma - Googleâ€™s new open LLM"|"Published February 21, 2024"|" The Gemma is a family of 4 new LLM models by Google based on Gemini. It comes in two sizes: 2B and 7B parameters, each with base (pretrained) and instruction-tuned versions. All variants  can be run on various types of hardware, even without quantization, and have a context length of 8K tokens."|"https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma"
