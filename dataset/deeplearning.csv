"Toward Safer, More Helpful Models"|"Mar 14, 2024"|" The technique known as reinforcement learning from human feedback fine-tunes large language models to be helpful and avoid generating harmful responses such as suggesting illegal or dangerous activities. An alternative method streamlines this approach and achieves better results. Yuntao Bai and colleagues at Anthropic fine-tuned a large language model (LLM) to follow human-made rules in a method they call Constitutional AI."|"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/toward-safer-more-helpful-models/"
"Learning Language by Exploration Agent develops language skills through simulated exploration tasks"|"Mar 13, 2024"|" Researchers trained a language model in a less focused, more human-like way. Researchers trained the agent to find a particular room in a two-dimensional layout of rooms. The authors focused on simple language (instructions limited to a few words and a very small vocabulary) that described a single domain."|"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/agent-develops-language-skills-through-simulated-exploration-tasks/"
"Schooling Language Models in Math GOAT (Good at Arithmetic Tasks), a method to boost large language models' arithmetic abilities"|"Mar 06, 2024"|" Large language models (LLMs) do fairly well at multiplication and division. They’re less adept at the more challenging tasks of multiplication and divisions. Researchers devised a way to perform these tasks well is to divide them into simpler subtasks. Together, these approaches can enable LLMs to perform more complicated mathematical tasks."|"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/schooling-language-models-in-math/"
"Human Feedback Without Reinforcement Learning"|"Feb 28, 2024"|" The model is used to fine-tune a pair of sentences to produce the best possible outcomes. The result of the model is the result of a model that is more likely to be more likely than the original. The model can be used to make the best of its own decisions."|"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/human-feedback-without-reinforcement-learning/"
"Swiss Army LLM"|"Feb 28, 2024"|" Toolformer is a self-supervised transformer that took advantage of Wikipedia, a calculator, a calendar, and other tools using the corresponding application programming interfaces (APIs) Toolformer was developed by Timo Schick and colleagues at Meta and Universitat Pompeu Fabra."|"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/swiss-army-llm/"
